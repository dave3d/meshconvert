Try mesh to GLB conversion in Google Colab[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/dave3d/meshconvert/blob/master/mesh2glb.ipynb)

Mesh conversion pipelines for use in NIH 3D workflows.  NIH 3D uses GLB as its main format.  
This repo provides a script to go from meshes to GLB, and another to go from GLB to other mesh
formats.  The other mesh formats include STL, PLY, OBJ, WRL and X3D.  Basically whatever
formats Trimesh or PyMeshLab support.
